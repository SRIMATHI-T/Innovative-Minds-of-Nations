  <h3>Nomination and selection of Economic sciences Laureates</h3> 
    <p>Nomination to the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel is by invitation only. The names of the nominees and other information about the nominations cannot be revealed until 50 years later.</p>
</div><center><h3>About the prize</h3>
<h5>In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. The prize is based on a donation received by the Nobel Foundation in 1968 from Sveriges Riksbank on the occasion of the bank’s 300th anniversary. The first prize in economic sciences was awarded to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen in 1969.
The prize in economic sciences is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm, Sweden, according to the same principles as for the Nobel Prizes that have been awarded since 1901.</h5></center>

    <h2>The 2023 economic sciences laureate</h2>
    <h2>Claudia Goldin</h2>
<p>
This year’s economic sciences laureate, Claudia Goldin, provided the first comprehensive account of women’s earnings and labour market participation through the centuries. By trawling through the archives and compiling and correcting historical data, Goldin has been able to present new and often surprising facts. The fact that women’s choices have often been, and remain, limited by marriage and responsibility for the home and family is at the heart of her analyses and explanatory models.
Her insights reach far outside the borders of the US and similar patterns have been observed in many other countries. Her research brings us a better understanding of the labour markets of yesterday, today and tomorrow.

<h3>Women in the labour market</h3>
<h4> Did you know that on average women still earn less than men? The research awarded the 2023 economic sciences prize gives us an idea</h4>
