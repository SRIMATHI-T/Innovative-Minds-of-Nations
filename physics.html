  <h2>THE NOBEL PRIZE</h2>
  <h3>Nomination and selection of physics laureates</h3> 
    <p>Nomination to the Nobel Prize in Physics is by invitation only. The names of the nominees and other information about the nominations cannot be revealed until 50 years later.</p>

      <h3>Process of nomination and selection</h3>
      <p>The Nobel Committee for Physics sends confidential forms to persons who are competent and qualified to nominate.<br>The right to submit proposals for the award of a Nobel Prize in Physics shall, by statute, be enjoyed by:<br><ol>
        <li>Members of the Nobel Committee for Physics;</li>
        <li>Nobel Prize laureates in physics;</li>
        <li>Swedish and foreign members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences;</li></p>

      <h3>Selection of Nobel Prize laureates</h3>
      <p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is responsible for the selection of the Nobel Prize laureates in physics. The Academy appoints a working body, the Nobel Committee for Physics, which screens the nominations and presents a proposal for final candidates. The committee consists nominally of five voting members, but since many years, it also includes voting adjunct members. The Committee’s proposal is discussed in a larger body, the Physics Class of the Academy, who may suggest a modification or forward a different proposal to the Academy. Finally, additional proposals may be raised at the final Academy meeting. It is in principle possible to suggest that no Prize be given the current year, but that is a seldom used choice.</p>

      <h3>Who is eligible for the Nobel Prize in Physics?</h3>        
      <p>The candidates eligible for the Physics Prize are those nominated by qualified persons who have received an invitation from the Nobel Committee to submit names for consideration. No one can nominate himself or herself.</p>
