  <h2>THE NOBEL PRIZE</h2>
  <h3>Nomination and selection of chemistry laureates</h3> 
    <p>Nomination to the Nobel Prize in chemistry is by invitation only. The names of the nominees and other information about the nominations cannot be revealed until 50 years later.</p>
</div><center><h3>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2023</h3>
<h4>They added colour to nanotechnology</h4>
<p>Moungi G. Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Aleksey Yekimov are awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2023 for the discovery and development of quantum dots. These tiny particles have unique properties and now spread their light from television screens and LED lamps. They catalyse chemical reactions and their clear light can illuminate tumour tissue for a surgeon.</p></center>

      <h3>Process of nomination and selection</h3>
      <p>The Nobel Committee for chemistry sends confidential forms to persons who are competent and qualified to nominate.<br>The right to submit proposals for the award of a Nobel Prize in chemistry shall, by statute, be enjoyed by:<br><ol>
        <li>Members of the Nobel Committee for chemistry and Physics;</li>
        <li>Nobel Prize laureates in chemistry and physics;</li>
        <li>Swedish and foreign members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences;</li>
        <li>Other scientists from whom the Academy may see fit to invite proposals.</li></p>

      <h3>Selection of Nobel Prize laureates</h3>
      <p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is responsible for the selection of the Nobel Prize laureates in chemistry.The Nobel Committee is the working body that screens the nominations and selects the final candidates. It consists of five members, but for many years the Committee has also adjunct members with the same voting rights as members. </p>

      <h3>Who is eligible for the Nobel Prize in chemistry?</h3>        
      <p>The candidates eligible for the Chemistry Prize are those nominated by qualified persons who have received an invitation from the Nobel Committee to submit names for consideration. No one can nominate himself or herself.</p>

    <h2>Nobel Prize in Chemistry</h2>
    <h3>The 2023 chemistry Laureates</h3>
<p>The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2023 was awarded to Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Aleksey Yekimov “for the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots.”
Independently of each other, Ekimov and Brus succeeded in creating quantum dots, and Bawendi revolutionised the chemical production.
Quantum dots now illuminate computer monitors and television screens based on QLED technology. They also add nuance to the light of some LED lamps, and biochemists and doctors use them to map biological tissue.
